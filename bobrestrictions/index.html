	<h3>Step 1:</h3>
	<p>We are going to need to get the IP of the device that needs to be restricted.</p>
	<p>In android this is fairly simple go to: "settings>wireless>long press the network its connected to> tap modify"<br>
	this should give you a page that has network name and other info, one of the titles should say IP address. Remeber this address (write it down or something)</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Step 3:</h3>
	<p>We are now going to make sure that the IP of the device won't change (internal IP's often change daily)</p>
	<p>Click the Status/diagnostic tab:</p>

	<h4>Step 3.2:</h4>
	<p>This page will take a few seconds to load and then you should be able to see all the devices on the network. Look for the device IP it should look like the highlighted one and select the tick box under "Fix IP address to client?"</p>

	<p>The page will reload</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Step 4:</h3>
	<p>Now we are going to setup the filtering</p>
	<p>Press the advanced settings tab</p>

	<h4>Step 4.1:</h4>
	<p>This page will load. Click the "4. Access control and parental control tools" tab. <br>

	<h4>Step 4.3:</h4>
	<p>Now we just need to edit the times and device that we are filtering.</p>
